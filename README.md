  ## Description
  For this application I wanted to create a back-end environment that allowed me to search, create, update, and delete categories, products, and tags so that a company that utilizes these techonlogies can compete with other e-commerce companies. 

  ## Installation
  To run this application the user must run npm i as well as log into mysql. once that has been done the schema must be ran and a node seed/index.js command must be exicuted to seed the pre-made data. Once the data has been seeded run an npm start command to spool up the server. Below I have included a video to help with installation and usage of this application

  ## Usage
  To use the app the installation instructions must be met before these steps will work. Once the server is up and running the user will be able to make get, post, put, and delete calls to the categories, products, and tags using insomnia.
